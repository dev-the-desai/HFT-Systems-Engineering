# HFT (High-Frequency Trading) Skills Development Path

This repository contains my personal learning path and projects for developing the skills necessary for high-frequency trading systems engineering.

## Learning Roadmap

The learning path is structured in progressive modules:

1. **Modern C++ and Memory Management**
   - Advanced C++ features for performance-critical systems
   - Lock-free programming techniques
   - Custom memory allocation and optimization

2. **Low-Latency Networking**
   - Kernel bypass technologies (DPDK)
   - High-precision timing and synchronization
   - Network optimization techniques

3. **Hardware Acceleration**
   - FPGA development for trading applications
   - Custom hardware/software interfaces
   - Accelerated data processing

4. **LLVM Optimization**
   - Custom optimization passes for trading algorithms
   - JIT compilation techniques
   - Performance analysis and improvement

5. **Financial Markets Fundamentals**
   - Market microstructure and order types
   - Exchange connectivity protocols
   - Trading system architecture

6. **Integrated Systems**
   - Full trading system development
   - Order management and execution
   - Market data processing

7. **Portfolio Projects**
   - Comprehensive demonstration projects
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Documentation and presentation

8. **Interview Preparation**
   - System design exercises
   - Coding challenges specific to HFT
   - Company research and behavioral preparation

## Timeline

This is a 12-month intensive learning program, with approximately 30-40 hours per week dedicated to study and project work.

## Project Structure

Each module contains:
- Learning resources (books, papers, courses)
- Hands-on projects with increasing complexity
- Performance benchmarks and tests
- Documentation

## Getting Started

The recommended starting point is with Module 1: Modern C++ and Memory Management, focusing first on the following projects:

1. LockFreeProgramming/RingBuffer - A lock-free circular buffer implementation
2. MemoryManagement/CustomAllocator - A specialized memory allocator for trading applications

## Resources

The global Resources directory contains broader learning materials:
- Books on trading systems, low-latency programming, and financial markets
- Academic papers on relevant topics
- Course materials and conference talks
- Sample market data for testing

## Goals

By completing this learning path, I aim to develop the skills necessary for roles such as:
- Systems Engineer at HFT firms
- Low-Latency Infrastructure Developer
- Market Data Systems Engineer
- Trading Systems Developer
