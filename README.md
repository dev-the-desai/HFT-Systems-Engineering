# HFT Systems Engineering

This repository documents my journey in developing the specialized skills necessary for high-frequency trading systems engineering. It contains implementations of various data structures, algorithms, and systems optimized for ultra-low latency and high throughput trading environments.

## Project Overview

High-frequency trading requires specialized knowledge across multiple domains including systems programming, networking, hardware acceleration, and market microstructure. This repository serves as both a structured learning path and a showcase of implementations that address the unique challenges of HFT systems.

## Learning Roadmap

The learning path is structured in progressive modules, designed as a comprehensive 12-month program with approximately 30-40 hours per week dedicated to study and project work:

   * Advanced C++ features for performance-critical systems
   * Lock-free programming techniques
   * Custom memory allocation and optimization
   * CPU cache awareness

2. **Low-Latency Networking**
   * Kernel bypass technologies (DPDK)
   * High-precision timing and synchronization
   * Network optimization techniques
   * Zero-copy data transfer

3. **Hardware Acceleration**
   * FPGA development for trading applications
   * Custom hardware/software interfaces
   * Accelerated data processing
   * CPU architecture optimization

4. **LLVM Optimization**
   * Custom optimization passes for trading algorithms
   * JIT compilation techniques
   * Performance analysis and improvement

5. **Financial Markets Fundamentals**
   * Market microstructure and order types
   * Exchange connectivity protocols
   * Trading system architecture
   * Order book management

6. **Integrated Systems**
   * Full trading system development
   * Order management and execution
   * Market data processing

Each directory contains implementations, tests, benchmarks, and documentation for specific components relevant to HFT systems engineering.

## Core Competencies

The projects in this repository focus on developing these core competencies:

1. **Ultra-Low Latency Programming**
   - Lock-free data structures
   - Memory management optimization
   - CPU cache awareness
   - Instruction-level optimization

2. **High-Performance Networking**
   - Kernel bypass techniques
   - Zero-copy data transfer
   - Network stack optimization
   - Minimal latency message processing

3. **Hardware-Software Co-design**
   - FPGA-based acceleration
   - CPU architecture optimization
   - Custom hardware interfaces

4. **Market Data Processing**
   - Order book management
   - Efficient market data representation
   - Statistically optimized data structures

## Benchmarking

Performance is measured rigorously across implementations:
- Latency (mean, median, tail latencies)
- Throughput (operations per second)
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory)
- Comparative analysis against standard libraries

## Getting Started

The recommended starting point is with Module 1: Modern C++ and Memory Management, focusing first on the following projects:
1. LockFreeProgramming/RingBuffer - A lock-free circular buffer implementation
2. MemoryManagement/CustomAllocator - A specialized memory allocator for trading applications

## Resources

The global Resources directory contains broader learning materials:
